# ðŸ§¬ Bioinformatics Project: How Does Viral Load Drive Virus Transmission?

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The project probes the impact of  viral load on the transmission of respiratory viruses in closed environments. I tried to come up with 
a physics-based simulation model  and applied the estimate infection risk with several ventilation conditions and  room sizes.

## Important Features
-Bioinformatics-style preprocessing and visualizations
- Physics-inspired simulation of airborne virus transmission
- Probabilistic infection modeling using Poisson distribution
- Statistical analysis via Poisson regression (GLM)
- Parametric control: room size, ventilation rate, viral load, exposure time
